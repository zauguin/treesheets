TreeSheets for Mac OS X Beta (treesheets.com)

This is mostly a direct port from the windows/linux version, and does NOT always adhere to Mac UI standards!
Do NOT use this software if you want a polished experience. It is Beta quality.

The main functionality all works, so ok for those who want to be using TreeSheets on a Mac also,
but expect things to work differently in the UI (mostly due to how wxWidgets implements them).  

Thanks to Robert Pointon (fernlightning.com) for his help getting the initial port done.
